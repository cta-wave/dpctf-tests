# DPCTF Tests

This repository contains tests for the [DPCTF Test
Runner](https://github.com/cta-wave/dpctf-test-runner).
This repository contains tests for the [DPCTF Deploy](https://github.com/cta-wave/dpctf-test-runner).

## Generate Tests

To generate tests use the `generate-tests.py` script as follows

```
$ ./generate-tests.py <CSV-file> <destination-dir> [<mpd-root-dir>]
```

**CSV-file**: CSV file to generate tests from.  
**destination-dir**: Directory to put generated tests into.  
**mpd-root-dir** (optional): The root directory of relative local mpd paths.

### CSV File Structure

Every row represents a generated test.

```csv
"<template-id>","<video-test-vector-url>","<audio-test-vector>","<group>"
```

**template-id**: What template to use.  
**video-test-vector-url**: URL to the video test content.  
**audio-test-vector-url**: URL to the audio test content.  
**group**: Name to group the generated test by. A directory per group is created.

You can refer to the [tests.csv](./tests.csv) for examples.
